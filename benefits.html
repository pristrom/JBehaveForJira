                        <p> Forget about writing User Stories in Word or Excel and use this <strong>intuitive story
                            writing tool </strong> instead to deliver requirements in the format that is easy to share
                            and to collaborate on with the rest of your team!</p>
                        <p> Heard of <strong>executable specifications</strong>
                            but always felt like it was far too big of an overhead to setup and maintain a suitable
                            environment to deliver it , then try this tool! It will make your story writing a breeze!  </p>


                        <h2 id="ssylka2">Developers & QA Engineers</h2>
                        <p> Stop developing features against loosely defined requirements and instead develop them against a <strong>clearly
                            defined scope</strong> in the form of user stories that every one can understand and verify. </p>

                        <p>  Gain <strong> better understanding of requirements </strong> by reading and collaborating on the user stories
                            with the business before development starts.</p>

                        <p> <strong> Improve your test coverage and regression testing </strong> as each story becomes an automated test case that you can easily
                            include in your continuous integration environment.</p>

                        <p>  Report bugs and edge case scenarios that are <strong> easily reproducible</strong>
                             by simply rerunning the specified story.</p>

                        <h2 id="ssylka3">Managers & Scrum Masters</h2>
                        <p>  Gain <strong> better visibility and confidence</strong> into what is actually done as no user story can be
                            considered complete while its automated story test is failing.</p>
                        <p>  <strong>Improve efficiency and communication</strong> of your whole team by making Jira the one stop
                            place to go for sharing, discussing and reviewing the stories being worked on.</p>

                    <!--<p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a technique for the design and implementation of software. TDD was first described as part of the Extreme Programming  software engineering process, and aims to encourage better software design. With TDD the architecture of the system is not determined up-front; the developer expands and implements the design.-->

                    <!--<h3>1. Create Unit Test</h3>-->
                    <!--<p>First, the developer creates a unit test that can show whether the functionality is implemented in the system in a way that complies with its requirement. This forces the developer to think about what it means to correctly implement the functionality. In a way the unit test functions as a design specification. If the test is executed it will fail, since there is no implementation yet.</p>-->
                    <!--<h3>2. Implement support</h3>-->
                    <!--<p>The next step is to implement the functionality in the simplest way possible. The developer focuses only on the changed functionality, and does not yet take into account the design as part of the larger system. The developer is done with the implementation when it successfully passes the unit test.</p>-->
                    <!--<h3>3. Refactor</h3>-->
                    <!--<p>In the final step the developer takes a step back and looks at what the implementation changes mean for the system as a whole. The changes may have introduced inconsistencies or duplication of functionality. The developer can improve the design by updating the system without affecting its functionality, an activity referred to as refactoring. Refactoring is enabled by the unit tests created during the first activity;the developer can change the system and the unit tests will give confidence that the system still functions correctly.</p>-->

                    <!--<center><h2>What is Behavior-driven development?</h2></center>-->
                    <!--<p>Dan North introduced Behavior-Driven Development as a different name for Test-Driven Development after observing that Test-Driven Development was often perceivedas a testing technique. By replacing the word "test" in the name of TDD with "behavior", BDD aimed to emphasize that TDD is about design, not testing.</p>-->
                    <!--<p>The requirements of the system are expressed as user stories and extended-->
                        <!--with acceptance criteria in the form of scenarios. These scenarios are then automated where feasible to form the automated acceptance tests required for ATDD. The design and implementation of the functionality required by stories takes place in TDD cycles. BDD has adopted the concept of a ubiquitous language from DDD. Although DDD uses the domain model in other ways and is primarily a design technique, BDD has not been explicitly associated with these other aspects of DDD. In this chapter we have provided on a high-level overview of BDD and its origins: Test-Driven Development, Acceptance Test-Driven Development and Domain Driven Design.-->
